I will start the project later.

30.3
I started the project. I added 4 classes:
 - Vector2D class which helps to calculate vectors.
 - Boid class where are the rules hoe the boid moves (doesnt work properly yet) and also draw function that draws the boid.
 - Boids class where is a buffer of all the boids, step() function that moves every boid and draw function that draws every boid to map
 - Simulation class where the canvas is created. Also has a timer function

I have only tested functions through user interface

No errors, only problem so far is that movement of the flock is not working as it should

workload has been about 5 hours so far

I have used 5 hours for my canvas and boid class so so far i'm on schedule

13.4
I added sliders and button. Updated bound function in Vector2D. 
I have tested functions through user interface. 
Got movement looking better by editing Alignment, Cohesion and Separation functions.
I have used around 15 hours to my project so far
